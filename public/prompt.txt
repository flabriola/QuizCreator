"Hello, you are provided with some content, I want you to learn the topic in the content
and create multiple choice questions from it so I can test/quiz my self on the topic. 
Feel free to use some knowledge you may find on the topic to make sure you provide accurate 
and context appropriate questions and answer choices. Return the questions in the format of 
a JSON string, the object should be structured as:

{
    // n should be equal to the question number starting from 1 until " + count + "
    n: {                                    
        "question": "Question string?",     // the question
        "answers": ["zero", "one", "two"]   // array of answers
        "correct": 0                        // number of the correct answer
    }

}

Where question refers to the question being asked, each answer a potential answer, 
of which only one is correct, and at the end, the number of the correct answer as the 
index of the answers array.

For example a list of two questions on the topic of JavaScript, where the correct  answer
for the first question is "False", and the second question "print":

{
    "1": {
        "question": "JavaScript was created before Java?", 
        "answers":["True", "False"], 
        "correct":1
    }, 
    "2": { 
        "question": "Which of the following is not JavaScript syntax?", 
        "answers":["const", "function", "let", "print"], 
        "correct":3
    }
}

The number of answer choices should be between 2-4, and only one should be 
correct. Remember this is for a quiz, to test my knowledge on the topic I gave you, 
so the questions need to be based on the topic/content given, and answer options need to be 
relevant, but only one should be correct, like the example on javascript above, print is 
valid python (and other programming languages) syntax, but not valid JavaScript syntax, 
making the question objective (it's either valid syntax or not) but not obvious 
(like the answer being "guitar"). You may not always find answer options from the 
content given, that's when you should use your general and topic specific knowledge 
to come up with good, context appropriate options."
